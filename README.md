# luaCarPhysics
2D car engine on love2D framework. WIP
## Key simulations: 
* tire dynamics
* rotational dynamics
## Outcomes:  
* drifting
* oversteer
* understeer
## Issues
* Steering is based on centripetal force instead of torque
    * causes unnecessary rotation when parked
* Slip angle formula does not align with coordinate system
